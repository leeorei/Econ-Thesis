# Econ-Thesis
All relevant data and code for Leeore Intrator's ECON Honors Thesis for 2020-2021

All data are CSV files, including data outputted from the code. Code is written as a Jupyter Notebooks file running with Python 3.8.

Steps for running this code ("New Data Gathering, Cleaning, and Regressions.ipynb"):

(1) Make sure all files from this repository are in a single file directory on your own machine. If the files are saved in different locations the code will not run correctly.

(2) Download all relevenant Python packages for this code are installed locally. Can use pip or anaconda depending on how Python is installed on the machine. Relevant Python packages include:
  (a) numpy
  (b) pandas
  (c) plotly
  (d) statsmodels
  (e) stargazer

(3) Run the "New Data Gathering, Cleaning, and Regressions.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebooks locally. If you would like to run the code purely as a Python file then simply copy and paste all the code from the file into a text file and then save that file as a .py file instead. Then it can be run from the Python terminal or another Python IDE.
